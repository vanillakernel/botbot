This is the bright candlelit room where the life-timers are stored - 
shelf upon shelf of them, squat hourglasses, one for every living person, 
pouring their fine sand from the future into the past. The accumulated hiss of 
the falling grains makes the room roar like the sea.

This is the owner of the room, stalking through it with a preoccupied air. His 
name is Death.

But not any Death. This is the Death whose particular sphere of operations is, 
well, not a sphere at all, but the Discworld, which is flat and rides on the 
back of four giant elephants who stand on the shell of the enormous star turtle 
Great A'Tuin, and which is bounded by a waterfall that cascades endlessly into 
space.

Scientists have calculated that the chance of anything so patently absurd 
actually existing are millions to one.

But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out 
of ten.

Death clicks across the black and white tiled floor on toes of bone, muttering 
inside his cowl as his skeletal fingers count along the rows of busy 
hourglasses.

Finally he finds one that seems to satisfy him, lifts it carefully from its 
shelf and carries it across to the nearest candle. He holds it so that the light 
lints off it, and stares at the little point of reflected brilliance.

The steady gaze from those twinkling eye-sockets encompasses the world turtle, 
sculling through the deeps of space, carapace scarred by comets and pitted by 
meteors. One day even Great A'Tuin will die, Death knows; now, that would be a 
challenge.

But the focus of his gaze dives onwards towards the blue-green magnificence of 
the Disc itself, turning slowly under its tiny orbiting sun.

Now it curves away towards the great mountain range called the Ramtops. The 
Ramtops are full of deep valleys and unexpected crags and considerably more 
geography than they know what to do with. They have their own peculiar weather, 
full of shrapnel rain and whiplash winds and permanent thunder-storms. Some 
people say it's all because the Ramtops are the home of old, wild magic. Mind 
you, some people will say anything.

Death blinks, adjusts for depth of vision. Now he sees the grassy country on the 
turnwise slopes of the mountains.

Now he sees a particular hillside.

Now he sees a field.

Now he sees a boy, running.

Now he watches.

Now, in a voice like lead slabs being dropped on granite, he says: YES.




There was no doubt that there was something magical in the soil of that hilly, 
broken area which - because of the strange tint that it gave to the local flora 
- was known as the octarine grass country. For example, it was one of the few 
places on the Disc where plants produced reannual varieties.

Reannuals are plants that grow backwards in time. You sow the seed this year and 
they grow last year.

Mort's family specialised in distilling the wine from reannual grapes. These 
were very powerful and much sought after by fortune-tellers, since of course 
they enabled them to see the future. The only snag was that you got the hangover 
the morning before, and had to drink a lot to get over it.

Reannual growers tended to be big, serious men, much given to introspection and 
close examination of the calendar. A farmer who neglects to sow ordinary seeds 
only loses the crop, whereas anyone who forgets to sow seeds of a crop that has 
already been harvested twelve months before risks disturbing the entire fabric 
of causality, not to mention acute embarrassment.

It was also acutely embarrassing to Mort's family that the youngest son was not 
at all serious and had about the same talent for horticulture that you would 
find in a dead starfish. It wasn't that he was unhelpful, but he had the land of 
vague, cheerful helpfulness that serious men soon learn to dread. There was 
something infectious, possibly even fatal, about it. He was tall, red-haired and 
freckled, with the sort of body that seems to be only marginally under its 
owner's control; it appeared to have been built out of knees.

On this particular day it was hurtling across the high fields, waving its hands 
and yelling.

Mort's father and uncle watched it disconsolately from the stone wall.

'What I don't understand,' said father Lezek, 'is that the birds don't even fly 
away. I'd fly away, if I saw it coining towards me.'
'Ah. The human body's a wonderful thing. I mean, his legs go all over the place 
but there's a fair turn of speed there.'
Mort reached the end of a furrow. An overfull woodpigeon lurched slowly out of 
his way.

'His heart's in the right place, mind,' said Lezek, carefully.

'Ah. 'Course, 'tis the rest of him that isn't.'
'He's clean about the house. Doesn't eat much,' said Lezek.

'No, I can see that.'
Lezek looked sideways at his brother, who was staring fixedly at the sky.

'I did hear you'd got a place going up at your farm, Hamesh,' he said.

'Ah. Got an apprentice in, didn't I?'
'Ah,' said Lezek gloomily, 'when was that, then?'
'Yesterday,' said his brother, lying with rattlesnake speed. 'All signed and 
sealed. Sorry. Look, I got nothing against young Mort, see, he's as nice a boy 
as you could wish to meet, it's just that -'
'I know, I know,' said Lezek. 'He couldn't find his arse with both hands.'
They stared at the distant figure. It had fallen over. Some pigeons had waddled 
over to inspect it.

'He's not stupid, mind,' said Hamesh. 'Not what you'd call stupid.'
'There's a brain there all right,' Lezek conceded. 'Sometimes he starts thinking 
so hard you has to hit him round the head to get his attention. His granny 
taught him to read, see. I reckon it overheated his mind.'
Mort had got up and tripped over his robe.

'You ought to set him to a trade,' said Hamesh, reflectively. 'The priesthood, 
maybe. Or wizardry. They do a lot of reading, wizards.'
They looked at each other. Into both their minds stole an inkling of what Mort 
might be capable of if he got his well-meaning hands on a book of magic.


Mort listened to the clatter of stone under the horse's hooves. Then there was 
the soft thud of packed earth as they reached the road, and then there was 
nothing at all.

He looked down and saw the landscape spread out below him, the night etched with 
moonlight silver. If he fell off, the only thing he'd hit was air.

He redoubled his grip on the saddle.

Then Death said, ARE YOU HUNGRY, BOY?
'Yes, sir.' The words came straight from his stomach without the intervention of 
his brain.

Death nodded, and reined in the horse. It stood on the air, the great circular 
panorama of the Disc glittering below it. Here and there a city was an range 
glow; in the warm seas nearer the Rim there was a hint of phosphorescence. In 
some of thedeep valleys the trapped daylight of the Disc, which is slow and 
slightly heavy[1], was evaporating like silver steam.

But it was outshone by the glow that rose towards the stars from the Rim itself. 
Vast streamers of light shimmered and glittered across the night. Great golden 
walls surrounded the world.
'It's beautiful,' said Mort softly. 'What is it?'
THE SUN is UNDER THE Disc, said Death.

'Is it like this every night?'
EVERY NIGHT, said Death. NATURE'S LIKE THAT.

'Doesn't anyone know?'
ME. You. THE GODS. GOOD, IS IT?
'Gosh!'
Death leaned over the saddle and looked down at the kingdoms of the world.

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, he Said, BUT I COULD MURDER A CURRY.


Death reached the street corner, the light from the flares raising brilliant 
highlights on the olished dome of his skull, and sniffed the air. A drunk 
staggered up, and without quite realising why made a slight detour in his 
erratic passage for no visible reason. THIS IS THE CITY, BOY, said Death. WHAT 
DO YOU THINK?
'It's very big,' said Mort, uncertainly. 'I mean, why does everyone want to live 
all squeezed together like this?'
Death shrugged.

I LIKE IT, he said. IT'S FULL OF LIFE.

'Sir?'
YES?
'What's a curry?'
The blue fires flared deep in the eyes of Death.

HAVE YOU EVER BITTEN A RED-HOT ICE CUBE?
'No, sir,' said Mort.

CURRY'S LIKE THAT.

'Sir?'
YES?
Mort swallowed hard. 'Excuse me, sir, but my dad said, if I don't understand, I 
was to ask questions, sir?'
VERY COMMENDABLE, said Death. He set off down a side street, the crowds parting 
in front of him like random molecules.

'Well, sir, I can't help noticing, the point is, well, the plain fact of it, 
sir, is -'
OUT WITH IT, BOY.

'How can you eat things, sir?'
Death pulled up short, so that Mort walked into him. When the boy started to 
speak he waved him into silence. He appeared to be listening to something.

THERE ARE TIMES, YOU KNOW, he said, half to himself, WHEN I GET REALLY UPSET.

He turned on one heel and set off down an alleyway at high speed, his cloak 
flying out behind him. The alley wound between dark walls and sleeping 
buildings, not so much a thoroughfare as a meandering gap.

Death stopped by a decrepit water butt and plunged his arm in at full length, 
bringing out a small sack with a brick tied to it. He drew his sword, a line of 
flickering blue fire in the darkness, and sliced through the string.

I GET VERY ANGRY INDEED, he said. He upended the sack and Mort watched the 
pathetic scraps of sodden fur slide out, to lie in their spreading puddle on the 
cobbles. Death reached out with his white fingers and stroked them gently.

After a while something like grey smoke curled up from the kittens and formed 
three small cat-shaped clouds in the air. They billowed occasionally, unsure of 
their shape, and blinked at Mort with puzzled grey eyes. When he tried to touch 
one his hand went straight through it, and tingled.

YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE AT THEIR BEST IN THIS JOB, aid Death. He blew on a kitten, 
sending it gently tumbling. Its miaow of complaint sounded as though it had come 
from a long way away via a tin tube.

They're souls, aren't they?' said Mort. 'What do people look like?'
PEOPLE SHAPED, said Death. IT'S BASICALLY ALL OWN TO THE CHARACTERISTIC 
MORPHOGENETIC FIELD.

He sighed like the swish of a shroud, picked the kittens out of the air, and 
carefully stowed them away somewhere in the dark recesses of his robe. He stood 
up.

CURRY TIME, he said.

'Is it magic?' said Mort.

WHAT DO YOU THINK? said Death. AM I REALLY HERE, BOY?
'Yes,' said Mort slowly. 'I . . . I've watched people. They look at you but they 
don't see you, I think. You do something to their minds.'
Death shook his head.

THEY DO IT ALL THEMSELVES, he said. THERE'S NO MAGIC. PEOPLE CANT SEE ME, THEY 
SIMPLY WONT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DO IT. UNTIL IT'S TIME, OF COURSE. WIZARDS CAN 
SEE ME, AND CATS. BUT YOUR AVERAGE HUMAN . . . NO, NEVER. He blew a smoke ring 
at the sky, and added, STRANGE BUT TRUE.

Mort watched the smoke ring wobble into the sky and drift away towards the 
river.

'I can see you,' he said.

THAT'S DIFFERENT.
ENTER.

The handle turned of its own accord. The door swung inward.

Death was seated behind a desk, peering intently into a vast leather book almost 
bigger than the desk itself. He looked up as Mort came in, keeping one 
calcareous finger marking his place, and grinned. There wasn't much of an 
alternative.

AH, he said, and then paused. Then he scratched his chin, with a noise like a 
fingernail being pulled across a comb.

WHO ARE YOU, BOY?
'Mort, sir,' said Mort. 'Your apprentice. You remember?'
Death stared at him for some time. Then the pinpoint blue eyes turned back at 
the book.

OH YES, he said, MORT. WELL, BOY, DO YOU SINCERELY WISH TO LEARN THE UTTERMOST 
SECRETS OF TIME AND SPACE?
'Yes, sir. I think so, sir.'
GOOD. THE STABLES ARE AROUND THE BACK. THE SHOVEL HANGS JUST INSIDE THE DOOR.

He looked down. He looked up. Mort hadn't moved.

IS IT BY ANY CHANCE POSSIBLE THAT YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND ME?
'Not fully, sir,' said Mort.

DUNG, BOY. DUNG. ALBERT HAS A COMPOST HEAP IN THE GARDEN. I IMAGINE THERE'S A 
WHEELBARROW SOMEWHERE ON THE PREMISES. GET ON WITH IT.

Mort nodded mournfully. 'Yes, sir. I see, sir. Sir?'
YES?
'Sir, I don't see what this has to do with the secrets of time and space.'
Death did not look up from his book.

THAT, he said, is BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE TO LEARN.
NTER.

Death was standing behind a lectern, poring over a map. He looked at Mort as if 
he wasn't entirely there.

YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE BAY OF MANTE, HAVE YOU? he said.

'No, sir,' said Mort. FAMOUS SHIPWRECK THERE.

'Was there?'
THERE WILL BE, said Death, IF I CAN FIND THE DAMN PLACE.

Mort walked around the lectern and peered at the map.

'You're going to sink the ship?' he said.

Death looked horrified.

CERTAINLY NOT. THERE WILL BE A COMBINATION OF BAD SEAMANSHIP, SHALLOW WATER AND 
A CONTRARY WIND.

'That's horrible,' said Mort. 'Will there be many drowned?'
THAT'S UP TO FATE, said Death, turning to the bookcase behind him and pulling 
out a heavy gazetteer. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. WHAT Is THAT SMELL?
'Me,' said Mort, simply.

AH. THE STABLES. Death paused, his hand on the spine of the book. AND WHY DO YOU 
THINK I DIRECTED YOU TO THE STABLES? THINK CAREFULLY, NOW.

Mort hesitated. He had been thinking carefully, in between counting 
wheelbarrows. He'd wondered if it had been to coordinate his hand and eye, or 
teach him the habit of obedience, or bring home to him the importance, on the 
human scale, of small tasks, or make him realise that even great men must start 
at the bottom. None of these explanations seemed exactly right.

'I think . . .' he began.

YES?
'Well, I think it was because you were up to your knees in horseshit, to tell 
you the truth.'
Death looked at him for a long time. Mort shifted uneasily from one foot to the 
other.

ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, snapped Death. CLARITY OF THOUGHT. REALISTIC APPROACH. VERY 
IMPORTANT IN A JOB LIKE OURS.

'Yes, sir. Sir?'
HMM? Death was struggling with the index.

'People die all the time, sir, don't they? Millions. You must be very busy. But 
-'
Death gave Mort the look he was coming to be familiar with. It started off as 
blank surprise, flickered briefly towards annoyance, called in for a drink at 
recognition and settled finally on vague forbearance.

BUT?
'I'd have thought you'd have been, well, out and about a bit more. You know. 
Stalking the streets. My granny's almanack's got a picture of you with a scythe 
and stuff.'
I SEE. I AM AFRAID IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT POINT INCARNATION 
AND NODE FOCUSING. I DON'T EXPECT YOU DO?
'I don't think so.'
GENERALLY I'M ONLY EXPECTED TO MAKE AN ACTUAL APPEARANCE ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

'Like a king, I suppose,' said Mort. 'I mean, a king is reigning even when he's 
doing something else or asleep, even. Is that it, sir?'
IT'LL DO, said Death, rolling up the maps. AND NOW, BOY, IF YOU'VE FINISHED THE 
STABLE YOU CAN GO AND SEE IF ALBERT HAS ANY JOBS HE WANTS DOING. IF YOU LIKE, 
YOU CAN COME OUT ON THE ROUND WITH ME THIS EVENING.

Mort nodded. Death went back to his big leather book, took up a pen, stared at 
it for a moment, and then looked up at Mort with his skull on one side.

HAVE YOU MET MY DAUGHTER? he said.

'Er. Yes, sir,' said Mort, his hand on the doorknob.

SHE IS A VERY PLEASANT GIRL, said Death, BUT I THINK SHE QUITE LIKES HAVING 
SOMEONE OF HER OWN AGE AROUND TO TALK TO.

'Sir?'
AND, OF COURSE, ONE DAY ALL THIS WILL BELONG TO HER.

Something like a small blue supernova flared for a moment in the depths of his 
eyesockets. It dawned on Mort that, with some embarrassment and complete lack of 
expertise, Death was trying to wink.

It was midnight in Ankh-Morpork, but in the great twin city the only difference 
between night and day was, well, it was darker. The markets were thronged, the 
spectators were still thickly clustered around the whore pits, runners-up in the 
city's eternal and byzantine gang warfare drifted silently down through the 
chilly waters of the river with lead weights tied to their feet, dealers in 
various illegal and even illogical delights plied their sidelong trade, burglars 
burgled, knives flashed starlight in alleyways, astrologers started their day's 
work and in the Shades a nightwatch-man who had lost his way rang his bell and 
cried out: 'Twelve o'clock and all's arrrrrgghhhh, . . .'
However, the Ankh-Morpork Chamber of Commerce would not be happy at the 
suggestion that the only real difference between their city and a swamp is the 
number of legs on the alligators, and indeed in the more select areas of Ankh, 
which tend to be in the hilly districts where there is a chance of a bit of 
wind, the nights are gentle and scented with habiscine and Cecillia blossoms.

On this particular night they were scented with saltpetre, too, because it was 
the tenth anniversary of the accession of the Patrician[7] and he had invited a 
few friends round for a drink, five hundred of them in this case, and was 
letting off fireworks. Laughter and the occasional gurgle of passion filled the 
palace gardens, and the evening had just got to that interesting stage where 
everyone had drunk too much for their own good but not enough actually to fall 
over. It is the kind of state in which one does things that one will recall with 
crimson shame in later life, such as blowing through a paper squeaker and 
laughing so much that one is sick.

In fact some two hundred of the Patrician's guests were now staggering and 
kicking their way through the Serpent Dance, a quaint Morporkian folkway which 
consisted of getting rather drunk, holding the waist of the person in front, and 
then wobbling and giggling uproariously in a long crocodile that wound through 
as many rooms as possible, preferably ones with breakables in, while kicking one 
leg vaguely in time with the beat, or at least in time with some other beat. 
This dance had gone on for half an hour and had wound through every room in the 
palace, picking up two trolls, the cook, the Patrician's head torturer, three 
waiters, a burglar who happened to be passing and a small pet swamp dragon.

Somewhere around the middle of the dance was fat Lord Rodley of Quirm, heir to 
the fabulous Quirm estates, whose current preoccupation was with the thin 
fingers gripping his waist. Under its bath of alcohol his brain kept trying to 
attract his attention.

'I say,' he called over his shoulder, as they oscillated for the tenth hilarious 
time through the enormous kitchen, 'not so tight, please.'
I AM MOST TERRIBLY SORRY.

'No offence, old chap. Do I know you?' said Lord Rodley, kicking vigorously on 
the back beat.

I THINK IT UNLIKELY. TELL ME, PLEASE, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ACTIVITY?
'What?' shouted Lord Rodley, above the sound of someone kicking in the door of a 
glass cabinet amid shrieks of merriment.

WHAT is THIS THING THAT WE DO? said the voice, with glacial patience.

'Haven't you been to a party before? Mind the glass, by the way.'
I AM AFRAID I DO NOT GET OUT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO. PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS. 
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH SEX?
'Not unless we pull up sharp, old boy, if you know what I mean?' said his 
lordship, and nudged his unseen fellow guest with his elbow.

'Ouch,' he said. A crash up ahead marked the demise of the cold buffet.

NO.

'What?'
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

'Mind the cream there, it's slippery - look, it's just a dance, all right? You 
do it for fun.'
FUN.

'That's right. Dada, dada, da - kick!' There was an audible pause.

WHO IS THIS FUN?
'No, fun isn't anybody, fun is what you have.'
WE ARE HAVING FUN?
'I thought I was,' said his lordship uncertainly. The voice by his ear was 
vaguely worrying him; it appeared to be arriving directly into his brain.

WHAT is THIS FUN?
'This is!'
TO KICK VIGOROUSLY IS FUN?
'Well, part of the fun. Kick!'
TO HEAR LOUD MUSIC IN HOT ROOMS IS FUN?
'Possibly.'
HOW IS THIS FUN MANIFEST?
'Well, it - look, either you're having fun or you're not, you don't have to ask 
me, you just know, all right? How did you get in here, anyway?' he added. 'Are 
you a friend of the Patrician?'
LET US SAY, HE PUTS BUSINESS MY WAY. I FELT I OUGHT TO LEARN SOMETHING OF HUMAN 
PLEASURES.

'Sounds like you've got a long way to go.'
I KNOW. PLEASE EXCUSE MY LAMENTABLE IGNORANCE. I WISH ONLY TO LEARN. ALL THESE 
PEOPLE, PLEASE - THEY ARE HAVING FUN?
'Yes!'
THEN THIS is FUN.

'I'm glad we've got that sorted out. Mind the chair,' snapped Lord Rodley, who 
was now feeling very unfunny and unpleasantly sober.

A voice behind him said quietly: THIS IS FUN. TO DRINK EXCESSIVELY IS FUN. WE 
ARE HAVING FUN. HE IS HAVING FUN. THIS IS SOME FUN. WHAT FUN.

Behind Death the Patrician's small pet swamp dragon held on grimly to the bony 
hips and thought: guards or no guards, next time we pass an open window I'm 
going to run like buggery.
